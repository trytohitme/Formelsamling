\section{Dividing Large Documents}\label{dividing}
You can divide your \LaTeX-Document into an arbitrary number of \TeX-Files
to avoid too big and therefore unhandy files (e.g. one file for every chapter).

For this, you insert in your main file (this one) for every subfile
the command '\verb#\input{subfile}#'. This leads to the same behavior
as if the content of the subfile would be at the place of the \verb#\input#-Command.
